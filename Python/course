alias python=python3.7

/> python3 --version


In order to permanently change the Python version run the following:

/> echo "alias python=python3" >> ~/.bash_aliases
/> echo "if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
. ~/.bash_aliases
fi" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bash_aliases

----------------------------------Answer from AWS support about python versions:

I. Why do we have two python versions in ubuntu AMI:
   The python/python2 command come from a package named "python2" and python3 come from "python3",
   The packages are different for python2 and python3.

   I suspect that the Ubuntu AMI had both packages installed when it was created. Certain applications
   work better with a specific version of python hence there can be two different versions of it.

II. How can the default python version be changed to python3:
a. There are two ways for doing this, one way is using "update-alternatives" command.
    # update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python /usr/bin/python3.7

   The above command creates a symlink of python -> /usr/bin/python3.8 in /etc/alternatives.

b. Another way of setting default to python 3.7 is using alias, edit
   the ~/.bashrc file and add the below entry at the end of the file.
    # alias python=python3.7

c. After following one of the above methods a or b, check python version
    # python --version

III. Python upgrade commands:
a. Upgrade using command line.
    # apt-get upgrade python3

b. Using user data script.
  Select Launch instances
    Step 1: Select the AMI
    Step 2: Choose Instance Type
    Step 3: Configure Instance Details
            Drop down "Advanced Details" at the bottom of the page and add below script in User data with "As text" radio button selected.
            ~~~
            #!/bin/bash
            # Updating the python package on Ubuntu

            sudo apt-get upgrade python3 -y
