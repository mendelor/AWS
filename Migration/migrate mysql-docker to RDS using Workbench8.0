Migrate Docker container Mysql to RDS using Workbench 8.0

/> docker-compose up -d

version: '3.0'
services:
 db:
   image: mysql
   volumes:
       - "./.data/db:/var/lib/mysql"
   environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
       MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
       MYSQL_USER: user
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: pass
   ports:
     - 3306:3306


Connect as a root and run the following commands inside the mysql container: 
#create user 'user'@'%' identified by 'pass';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'user'@'%' with grant option;
flush privileges;

Create a Workbench connection for the container, ip should be the public ip where docker is running and port 3306, user and password pass

Create a table inside the container schema and add data      (the engine I worked with is innoDB)

server => data export => select the schemas => choose the saving path => start export

Then: 

Create an rds instance mysql version 8.0.23   (user admin, pass 12345678)  with public access

Connect to your RDS instance with workbench   (create a new connection)

Create a schema called mydb     (like appears in the mysql docker container) 

server => data import from self-contained file:  <choose the file you've saved earlier
choose default target schema: mydb  => start import
