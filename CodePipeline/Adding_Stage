You can add another stage to your CodePipeline by editing[1] it after it is created using the Edit button on top of that specific pipeline page, On the edit page you can use "+ add stage" buttons shown between stages and on the end, then enter a name (test) for your new stage, A stage is simply a collection of actions.

In your new stage you need to define at least one action[2] which can range from a manual approval with optional SNS notification to many other supported action providers such as a CodeBuild or Lambda trigger action.

If you'd like to learn more about what actions, stages and other CodePipeline concepts you can take a look here [3].

I hope this information proves to be useful and helps you to do the required modifications to your CodePipeline. Let me know if you have any additional queries and I would be happy to address them all.

Have a great day.
